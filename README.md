## üîå Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install Reddit Content Integration Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@alexandros-lekkas/reddit-mcp-server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install reddit-mcp-server --client claude
```

### Manual Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/jordanburke/reddit-mcp-server`

2. Create a Reddit app [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb7582d6-abf2-4282-a102-bd2e0f2c1c41)

Make sure to select "script"!

3. Copy the client ID and client secret

4. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`

Do this with your `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` and `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`

If you want to write posts you need to include your `REDDIT_USERNAME` and `REDDIT_PASSWORD` (don't worry, I won't steal them üòú)

5. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`

6. Build the project with `pnpm build`

7. Run with `pnpm dev` and open the inspection server (http://127.0.0.1:6274/)

8. If the connection works, add this to your MCP config (for Cursor or Claude Desktop)

```json
  "mcpServers": {
    "reddit": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "reddit-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "REDDIT_CLIENT_ID": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
        "REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>",
        "REDDIT_USERNAME": "<YOUR_USERNAME_OPTIONAL>",
        "REDDIT_PASSWORD": "<YOUR_PASSWORD_OPTIONAL>"
      },
      "autoApprove": [
        "get_reddit_post",
        "get_top_posts",
        "get_user_info",
        "get_subreddit_info",
        "get_trending_subreddits",
        "search_reddit",
        "get_post_comments",
        "get_user_posts",
        "get_user_comments",
        "create_post",
        "reply_to_post"
      ] // You don't need to add this, but it makes it so that you don't have to keep clicking approve
    }
  }
```

(Make sure to replace the environmental variables with your actual keys, not the üòú emoji)
